# Our Vision

In professional sports, putting health first in order to see a performance increase is foundational. Athletes regularly talk about rest, treatment, training, diet, coaching, and mental health as the primary inputs to see output in their respective field. This is then taught and reinforced by mentors, team leaders, coaches, and doctors in that sport. This line of thinking doesn't regularly exist for tech workers or software developers because we use our brains more than our physical bodies to produce output. Due to this flawed logic, prioritizing mental and physical health is not yet taught in any depth in learning settings such as university programs or coding bootcamps.

Our mission at G2i is to increase developer health; the physical and mental health software developers. This is the most underserved area in technology today, similar to many professional sports environments in the 1970's. Athletes were provided a team doctor and they had to figure the rest out themselves. Fast forward to today where we see professional athletes receive the highest level of care and technology to support their recovery, rest, and performance. We want to do this for the software developer and the tech worker. The tech industry should continue to spend time on better developer experience through open source and better tooling. However, it's time we look outside of the computer to focus on the health of the person actually writing the code.
